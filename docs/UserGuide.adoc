== Introduction

Investigapptor is a desktop application for a team of professional
investigators to easily manage crime cases that have been
delegated to them.

Investigapptor comes with many useful features for investigators and
their team members such as assigning investigators to a crime case, listing investigators
based on their expertise. This would allow for one to choose the best investigator for a
particular crime case based on their expertise+

Investigapptor v1.5 is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Unix operating systems.

To get started, go to <<Quick Start, Quick Start>> for information on how to set
up Investigapptor.

|=======================================================================
|Colour |Meaning
|Red |Case has the status of `open`
|Green |Case has the status of `close`
|=======================================================================

[[closecaseentries]]
====== Close Case Entries (Green)
When the case status is `close`, the calendar will indicate an entry that spans
from its start date to its end date. For example, as shown in _<<green-entry>>_
below, the closed case, Project Magic has a start date of "01/04/2018" and end date of

Cases with the status `close` will span from its start date to end date
in the calendar unlike <<opencaseentries, open case entries>>.
====

[[opencaseentries]]
====== Open Case Entries (Red)
When the case status is `open`, the calendar will indicate an entry on its start date.
For example, as shown in _<<red-entry>>_ below,
the open case, Project Three has a start date of "01/04/2018". Similarly,
for Project Two, it has a status of `open` and a start date of "03/04/2018".

=== Case Commands
These are case related commands. +

[[AddCase]]
==== Adding a case: `addcase` [Since v1.1]

The first step to managing your cases is to add them to the application along with their details. +
*Format:* `addcase n/CASE_NAME d/DESCRIPTION i/INVESTIGATOR_INDEX s/START_DATE [t/TAG]...` +
*Shorthand Format:* `ac`

[TIP]
Tags are optional, but you can add as many as you like to a case to help you organize better.

*Examples:*

* `addcase n/Geylang Rape d/Rape at geylang i/1 s/12/05/1994 t/Rape t/prostitution`
* `addcase n/Bedok Riot i/3 s/12/05/2017 d/Riot at bedok 85 t/Rape t/prostitution`

 the Investigapptor. +

[NOTE]

****

[WARNING]
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
[WARNING]
When editing tags, the existing tags of the case will be replaced by the new tags entered i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

[TIP]
To help you find the index of the case that you want to edit, you can use the `findcases` command before using the `editcase` command to narrow the number of cases displayed in the listing.
[TIP]
You can remove all the investigator's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

*Examples:*

* `editcase 1 d/some description i/1` +
Edits the description and investigator of the 1st case to be `some description` and the 1st investigator in the most recent listing of investigators respectively.
