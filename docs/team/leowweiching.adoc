== PROJECT: Investigapptor

---

== Overview

Investigapptor is a desktop application used for investigators to manage cases as simple, straightforward and efficient as possible.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *support for managing investigation cases*
** What it does: allows the user to add, delete, edit, find, and view case details in Investigapptor
** Justification: As Investigapptor is a tool for managing investigations, the ability to store, modify, and view case information is fundamental to the functionality of the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement touched on the logic, model, storage, and UI components. In the model component, a new package had to be introduced to store case information.

* *Minor enhancement*: updated the GUI with a new colour scheme and style
** Highlights: Styled with CSS
