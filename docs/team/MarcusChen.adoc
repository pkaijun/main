== PROJECT: INVESTIGAPPTOR

---

== Overview

Investigapptor is a desktop application used for investigators to manage cases as simple, straightforward and efficient as possible.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the Investigator package, which is a subclass of the person class
** What it does: Allows Investigapptor to store a new type of person in the address book that is can handle and more methods and data for Investigator.

** Justification: This enhancement is required as the person package is insufficient to perform the task required. As I wanted to accommodate future enhance of more types of people, the person class was used as a superclass to store the
basic information rather than just morphing the person class.
** Highlights: This enhancement has includes much changes to the model component of the Investigapptor allowing it to apply the same general commands to all subclass of the Person class while still being able to use specfic command for specific classes.
The Investigator also stores a live reference to all his cases that works with undo/redo feature by the usage of hashcode to always ensure it reference the correct case.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Implemented Backup command:
+
Allows user to create and name a backup of the current state of the investigapptor.
** Implemented ListInvestigatorCases command:
+
Allows user to view all cases allocated to the selected investigator.
** Implemented GUI for Investigator Details:

*** EditInvestigatorCommand
*** DeleteInvestigatorCommand
** Implemented CrimeCaseBuilder class
+
CrimeCaseBuilder used in JUnit testing to help build CrimeCase
** Implemented InvestigatorBuilder class
+
InvestigatorBuilder used in JUnit testing to help build CrimeCase
